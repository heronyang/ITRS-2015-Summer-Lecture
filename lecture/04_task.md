# Final Task

## Abstract

After our one week workshop, you should gain following knowledges:

- HTML (website structure)
- CSS (design/layout)
- JavaScript / jQuery (dynamic functions)
- Git (publish website online)

also,

- know how to search solutions on your own
- realize what can you do and what you can't via websites

Now, we are building one last website to end this workshop having following design goal:

    test the users' typing speed

## Specification

**Elements on the website:**

- one header
- one character
- one start button, one reset button
- one clock

**Flow**
- load page, timer is set to 1:00
- click start button, timer start to count down
- user type the character shown on the screen (case sensitive)
- show accuracy and how many characters per minute when the time's up
- click reset button to reset everything (back to the first step)

## Bonus

- remove start button, and the timer starts automatically when first key pressed?
- improve your visual design, and test it on different screen sizes / browsers
- change to "word" instead of "character"
- show future words (or "character"), so the user have time to prepare
- load the words randomly
- support mobile
